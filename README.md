## Description
I will analyze "New York City Airbnb Open Data" on Kaggle. The data file provides comprehensive information about the Airbnb data in New York City. The data includes information about host information, location, minimum days to stay, number of reviews, etc. Here is the website to download data: https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data.
I will mainly answer these three questions:
* What are the busiest Airbnb locations in New York City?
* Will the level of busyness effect the price?
* Is there a linear relationship between the price and the number of reviews so that hosts might be able to have more reviews by applying discounts on the price?
